    question: "What Are The Basic Steps To Buying A Property In The UAE Or Monaco?",
    answer:
      "The process usually starts with selecting a property that suits your budget and preferences, followed by signing a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the seller. A deposit is then paid, usually around 10% of the property price, before proceeding with legal verification and approvals. In the UAE, registration is completed at the Land Department, while in Monaco, the notary office oversees the transaction. Finally, full payment is made, and ownership is officially transferred to the buyer.",
